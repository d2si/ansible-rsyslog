 * `rsyslog_d_dir`: string, where are the config files`
 * `rsyslog_user`: the owner group of `rsyslog.conf`

### Specific variables

Rsyslog support traffic encryption with TLS (SSL). [More info](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/tls_cert_summary.html)

To enable it, `ca_certificate` must be defined, and `ssl` must be set to true for hosts to which you want to encrypt traffic.


*Example*:

```yaml
  vars:
    ca_certificate: "root-ca.pem"
    rsyslog_remote_loggers:
      syslog-ng1:
        remote_host: "securelogserver.example.com"
        remote_port: "10514"
        ssl: true
        filters:
          - "auth.*"
          - "local6.*"
      syslog-ng2:
        remote_host: "logserver.example.com"
        remote_port: "514"
        ssl: false
        filters:
          - "auth.*"
```
